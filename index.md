## Currently

I'm a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at [Illumina](http://www.illumina.com/), based at their R&D site near Cambridge in the UK. Here I work on solutions to key informatics hurdles in the sequencing space, such as efficient and automated bioinformatics data analysis. I enjoy solving hard problems by writing quality software, preferably leveraging modern programming languages, agile development practices and effective cloud services.

## Employment

`2020-` 
__Illumina, Inc.__ Senior Bioinformatics Scientist (software engineer and solutions architect). 
> My work includes integrating Illumina's best-in-class _DRAGEN_ bioinformatics analysis pipelines with our flagship cloud platforms (_BaseSpace Sequence Hub_ and _Illumina Connected Analytics_). I also develop public tools such as the BaseSpace Sequence Hub Commandline Interface, alongside many other internal software engineering projects ranging from bioinformatics scripts to web applications.

`2015-20` 
__Illumina, Inc.__ Bioinformatics Scientist (data scientist and statistical programmer).
> I joined Illumina's R&D organisation in 2015 where I worked on a wide range of bioinformatics and data science projects. Some public-facing work focused on variant comparison and analysis tooling, and I also advanced the popular _Platinum Genomes_ gold-standard variant truthset by introducing novel validation methods.

## Projects

### github

My [personal github account](https://github.com/blmoore) hosts my hobby development projects as well as listing contributions to open source tools. Examples include: shiny apps [blackspot](https://github.com/blmoore/blackspot) and [shinybrot](https://github.com/blmoore/shinybrot), as well as an R package hosted by CRAN ([mandelbrot](https://github.com/blmoore/mandelbrot)).

### blog

I write a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io/blog) where I apply R and Python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. My original wordpress blog ([benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com](http://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com)) has received over 150,000 unique visitors from 180 countries.

### EdinbR

I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I helped to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR).

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account.
