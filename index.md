## Currently

I'm a second-year energy science and energy PhD student at the University of Tennessee, in partnership with the Fuels, Engines, and Emissions Research Center (FEERC) at Oak Ridge National Lab. In this interdisplinary study, I have taken full advantage of developing a project that leverages strong core areas for ORNL to a new opportunity for the lab. My primary focus is to develop metallic gradients through additive manufacturing for end-use components to improve vehicle efficiency. Through successfully defending a lab SEED proposal and becoming the first of 2 projects sponsored by the Vehicle Technology Office in additive manufacturing, I have assembled a team in each core competency to tackle this issue: additive manufacturing, high temperature materials, and engines. To add depth to this area of concentration, I have found great interest in fuel economy analysis, helped in the design of 2 additively manufactured vehicles at the lab, and participate in dynamic neutron imaging of fuel injector sprays. I am actively building on programming skills with the R language to introduce statistical methods and web development to help find new ways to collaborate with open science.

## Projects

### blog

I write a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io) where I apply R and Python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. My original wordpress blog ([benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com](http://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com)) has received around 150,000 total views from 180 countries.

### EdinbR
I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I help to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR).

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: Â£2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account.

## Transportation Experience

`2013`
__Toyota Motor North America__ (_Washington, DC_)
Worked for one summer in fuel economy policy with TMNA's Energy and Environmental Research Group, designing a GUI in Microsoft Virtual Basic to interface with a planned vehicle decision model, a Chart Resize Tool in Virtual Basic, and developed several fuel economy policy related documents regarding energy saved by hybrids on the road and a comparision of the US and European fleet. 

`2011-2013`
__Virginia Department of Transportation__ (_Suffolk, VA_)
